# bistec-studio — E2E Test Plan

**Created:** 2026-06-23
**Status:** ✅ Full §6 catalog implemented **and green**. **Unit as of 2026-07-27 (PR #40): 322/322.** The CI gate (`.github/workflows/e2e.yml`) passed on PRs #38, #39 and #40. Last full _local_ run with recorded counts (2026-07-22, `feature/team-tenancy` branch, post TC-REG-H7a de-flake): **171 passed, 4 skipped, 0 failed** (175 tests total; 0 flaky — TC-REG-H7a's parallel-fire assertion was rewritten to a timing-robust integrity invariant, see below), unit **264/264** at that time.

Last full run on `main` (2026-07-13, post brief-draft-recovery §P): **132 passed, 0 failed, 7 skipped** (`npm run test:e2e:mock`; the machine lacked `BISTEC_API_KEYS` in `.env.test`, so 3 §J ACP-auth cases skipped on top of the 4 intentional skips below — CI sets the keys as job env and runs them). The 2026-07-13 feature batch added `async-generation.test.ts` (F1 async + retry), a version back/forward-jump case (F2), F4 auto-scheduling cases in `campaign-scheduling.test.ts`, `brandkit-assistant.test.ts` (F5), and `image-to-template.test.ts` (F6); generation-dependent suites now poll via the `waitForDraft` helper (generation is async). A GitHub Actions gate (`.github/workflows/e2e.yml`) runs the whole suite — including the §K security-fix regressions — on every PR and push to `main`, and is **green as of 2026-07-13** (it had been red for weeks on a bad CI `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` — it MUST be a valid 64-char hex string, else `crypto.ts` throws and the credential-encrypting routes 500). Runs on GitHub-hosted `ubuntu-latest` with the actions on the Node 24 runtime.

> **⚠️ Coverage gap this suite cannot see (learned from PR #40).** The suite runs `DESIGN_PROVIDER=claude-html` — **API mode** — so every CLI-mode-only code path is untested here, including the one where copy defaults to `claude -p` with no COPY provider registered. PR #40's bug (the wizard's Generate button dead on a team with no COPY provider) was invisible to this suite for that reason _and_ because the local seed added a `cli` COPY row that satisfied the gate. When changing provider-resolution or credential-chain behaviour, cover it in **unit** tests against the pure helpers (`resolveBriefCopyKey` / `canSubmitBrief`, `resolveCopyProvider`, `resolveClaudeAuth`) — do not assume a green E2E run says anything about CLI mode.

> **Update (2026-07-21, team tenancy):** two new suites on `feature/team-tenancy` — **`team-isolation.test.ts` (§R, 19 cases)** is the cross-tenant isolation guardrail: for every list/by-id/mutation route across briefs, drafts, posts, campaigns, projects, brand kits, and the scheduled-generation queue, a second team (**ClientX**, seeded by `scripts/seed-teams.mjs` alongside the default **Bistec** team, admin `clientx.admin`/`BistecStudio2026!`) must get a 404 (never a 403 — cross-team existence must not leak) trying to read or mutate Bistec's rows, and vice versa; it also exercises the D6 visibility rule (an editor sees own items + anything under a campaign; a team admin sees the whole team) and asserts `/api/me` team fields + the `bistec-active-team` cookie contract (409 `team-choice-required` for an unpicked multi-team user). **`team-settings.test.ts` (§S, 7 cases)** covers the new credential surfaces: personal Claude/OpenAI keys at `/settings` (`GET/PUT/DELETE /api/me/openai-key`), team Claude token / AI providers / social channels / `ApiKey` CRUD at `/team` (`withTeamAdmin`-gated, editor 403s), and `/admin/teams` team + membership management (super-admin-only). Pre-existing suites updated for the new contracts: **`TC-AGUI-06`** (`agui-refinement.test.ts`) rewritten — a campaign-shared draft is now a legitimate 202 for an in-team editor under D6, not a 403; **§J** ACP-auth cases (`acp.test.ts`) now mint real hashed `ApiKey` rows via `POST /api/team/api-keys` instead of relying on `BISTEC_API_KEYS`/`BISTEC_ADMIN_API_KEYS` env lists (both env vars are deleted). The isolation suite (plus the final whole-branch review) is also what caught 16 real cross-tenant gaps during the branch's build (8 from §R itself, 1 from a same-day Anthropic-key-resolution follow-up, 7 from the final review's brand-kit/template boundary sweep — §R gained 4 cases covering those attack shapes) — all fixed before this run; see `docs/handoff.md`'s 2026-07-21 entry. Full-suite count for the team-tenancy work: 132 → **170 passed** (4 intentional skips unchanged, 0 failed); unit 247 → **264 passed**. (A later 2026-07-22 commit de-flaked TC-REG-H7a's parallel-fire assertion, bringing the current HEAD count to **171 passed / 4 skipped / 0 failed** — see the Status line above.)

> **Update (2026-08-07, deck library consolidation):** decks now surface in the main **Library** (`GET /api/library`), not just the dedicated deck-review page, and slides gained per-slide prompted refine. `library.test.ts` (§H) grows from 5 to **10 cases**: TC-LIB-06 (a deck's own slide `Draft`s are excluded from post tiles — `deckSlide: null` — so a deck never double-counts as N standalone posts), TC-LIB-07 (a multi-slide deck is exactly one item; `slideCount`/`readySlideCount` reflect every slide), TC-LIB-08 (cross-team deck invisibility, same D6 shape as TC-LIB-01), TC-LIB-09 (search matches a deck's own `topic`, same substring semantics as TC-LIB-03), and TC-LIB-10 (the `FAILED` status tab returns only Posts whose publish actually `FAILED` — decks ignore the status filter entirely per design.md Key Decision 2, so a non-`FAILED` deck still shows up alongside them; gated on `MOCK_SOCIAL` since it needs a real publish attempt). `GET /api/library`'s response envelope changed from `{drafts}` to `{items}` (a `LibraryItem` union of `{type:'post',...DraftRecord}` and `{type:'deck',...DeckLibraryItem}`) — every existing §H case updated to the new shape via a shared `libraryItems()` test helper. `deck-generation.test.ts` (§U) grows from 4 to **6 cases**: TC-DECK-05 (a per-slide refine instruction, posted straight to the existing single-draft `POST /api/drafts/[id]/refine` route with that slide's `draftId` — there is no deck-scoped refine endpoint, design.md Key Decision 5 — re-renders only that slide; a sibling slide's `exportUrl` is provably untouched) and TC-DECK-06 (a refine that resolves into a brand-kit conflict, via the existing `conflict_test:` sentinel, sets that slide's `hasPendingConflict` without advancing its `exportUrl` — a clean completion, not a pending regenerate — so the deck page's poll can resolve it immediately instead of waiting out the regenerate timeout). New unit suite `tests/unit/library/mergeLibraryItems.test.ts` covers the pure merge-and-paginate helper (draft-only page, deck-only page, a page straddling the boundary between the two sorted sources, empty input, stable ordering on `createdAt` ties).
>
> **Update (2026-08-04, slide deck generation):** new suite **`deck-generation.test.ts` (§U, 4 cases)** — the new "Slide Deck" flow (BL-07): `Deck`/`DeckSlide` own real `Brief`+`Draft` rows per slide, so Path A/B generation/rendering/regenerate are reused unmodified. Contract: `POST /api/decks` (201 `{deckId}`) → `POST /api/decks/[id]/outline` (202; `Deck.proposedOutline` + `status: OUTLINE_READY`, Haiku call capped at `MAX_DECK_SLIDES=15`, falls back to one generic slide if the model proposes zero) → `POST /api/decks/[id]/outline/approve` with a (possibly user-edited) `{slides}` body (202; creates N independent Brief+Draft+DeckSlide trios in an all-or-nothing per-slide transaction, then fires `startBackgroundGeneration` per slide, fully independent of each other) → `GET /api/decks/[id]` (deck + slides, each surfacing its Draft's `status`/`exportUrl`/`failureReason` for polling) → `POST /api/decks/[id]/slides/[slideId]/regenerate-design` (202/409, identical claim semantics to the single-draft route via `claimDeckSlideAction`) → `POST /api/decks/[id]/export/pptx` (200 binary multi-slide `.pptx`, one image slide per `DeckSlide` in `orderIndex` order, sized to the deck's own aspect ratio | 422 if any slide isn't yet `EXPORTED`). Cases: the full happy path (create → propose+edit outline → approve → poll every slide to `EXPORTED` → regenerate one slide → export pptx), the 422-before-any-slide-exists / 404-cross-deck-slide pair, cross-team invisibility (404, no existence leak, same D6 shape as Draft/Brief via `deckVisibilityWhere`/`canAccessContent`), and campaign-shared visibility for a non-owning editor vs. an uncategorized deck staying owner-only. New unit suites: `tests/unit/deck/outline.test.ts` (outline parsing/capping/zero-slide fallback), `tests/unit/deck/generateDeck.test.ts` (per-slide all-or-nothing row creation + independent fan-out), `tests/unit/deckActions.test.ts` (deck-scoped claim wrapper), 5 new cases in `tests/unit/visibility.test.ts` (deck D6 semantics), and `tests/unit/export/pptx.test.ts` gained multi-slide `buildMultiSlidePptxBuffer` cases (existing single-slide contract unchanged). **Confirmed green 2026-08-04** against a clean MOCK_AI/MOCK_PUPPETEER/test-DB stack (`NODE_ENV` unset, per the guard in `src/lib/env.ts`) — 4/4 §U cases pass. The first live run surfaced two test-only bugs, both fixed: (1) the test assumed `Deck.proposedOutline` was a bare array, but it's `{slides: [...]}` everywhere in the real API; (2) presigned export URLs are re-signed on every `GET` (H10), so "unchanged" assertions must compare the bare object path, not the full URL with its date/signature query — the same convention `async-actions.test.ts` already used. Without fix (2), `waitForSlideExportChange`'s poll loop returned on its very first iteration regardless of whether the regenerate had actually finished.

> **Update (2026-08-03, pptx slide export):** new suite **`pptx-export.test.ts` (§T, 4 cases)** — `POST /api/drafts/[id]/export/pptx` (image-backed single-slide `.pptx`, slide dimensions matching the draft's own aspect ratio, generated on-demand and not persisted): happy path on an already-exported draft (200, correct `Content-Type`, non-empty zip-magic-byte body, `exportUrl` unchanged — no re-render), render-if-missing path (draft has `htmlContent` but no `exportUrl` yet — the route renders + stores the PNG first via the same `renderAndStoreExport` helper `/api/generate/export` now shares, then draft ends up `EXPORTED`), 422 for a draft with no `htmlContent`, and 404 for a cross-team draft (via the ClientX admin, same isolation pattern as §R). New unit suite `tests/unit/export/pptx.test.ts` (10 cases) covers `buildPptxBuffer`/`pptxFilename` directly (one case per `AspectRatio`, filename-slug edge cases) — full unit count 354 → **364 passed**.
>
> **Update (2026-07-28, copy-edit status clobber):** §Q gained **TC-ASYNC-10** — a manual copy edit, _including clearing the copy entirely_, must not disturb `Draft.status`. `PATCH /api/drafts/[id]` used to flip `EXPORTED` → `IN_PROGRESS` ("the export is stale"), which dropped the draft from the library, hid Refine design / Edit inline, made regenerate-copy answer 409 `Draft is not ready for copy regeneration`, left the copy block on an uneditable "Writing the copy…" skeleton, and after 15 min let the stale sweep mark the draft `FAILED` — with nothing regenerating. The case asserts: PATCH response itself says `EXPORTED` with design untouched (same `htmlContent`/export path/revision pointer), `copyText: ''` also stays `EXPORTED`, the draft is still listed by `/api/library?status=READY`, regenerate-copy is accepted (202) and refills the copy, and refine is accepted (202) advancing to revision 2. Suite is now **10 cases**.
>
> **Update (2026-07-17, async draft actions):** new suite **`async-actions.test.ts` (§Q, 9 cases)** — the three draft actions (`regenerate-design`/`regenerate-copy`/`refine`) are now async (F1 pattern): sync validation keeps the legacy shapes (404/403, 400 `NOT_PATH_B`/`instruction is required`, 422 `NO_BRAND_KIT`/`COPY_ERROR`, regenerate-copy 409 unless EXPORTED/PUBLISHED), then an atomic `Draft.pendingAction` claim → **202 `{ok:true}`** and background execution; `GET /api/drafts/[id]` gained `pendingAction`/`pendingActionError`/`conflict {conflictId, explanation}` (never `pendingHtml`). Cases: 202→poll happy paths for all three actions (new revision + advanced `currentRevisionNumber` for design/refine; copy replaced with design/status untouched), refine conflict via poll + still-synchronous Override (`{reply,revisionId,exportUrl}`), 409 `Another action is already running on this draft` on all three actions **and restore** while a claim is seeded (direct test-DB write), lazy 15-min stale sweep on GET (raw-SQL `updatedAt` rewind — Prisma's `@updatedAt` would auto-touch), and failure-sentinel runs (`__FAIL_GEN_ALWAYS__` in the refine _instruction_, or rewritten into the _brief topic_ in the DB for regenerate-design) proving `pendingActionError` is set, previous content stays intact, and the next claim clears the error. Test infra: **`waitForAction(api, draftId, {timeoutMs, intervalMs})`** in `tests/helpers/api.ts` (polls until `pendingAction === null`). `agui-refinement.test.ts` updated to the async refine contract (202 + `waitForAction`; Override stays sync; the H7 case is now sequential — parallel refines 409 by design). `brand-kit.test.ts` gained **TC-BK-09** (logo-URL hygiene: `data:` URI `logoUrl` → 400 on POST create and PATCH; `logoUrl: null` still clears). ⚠️ Known catalog casualty: **TC-REG-H7a** (10 parallel refines → 10 revisions) contradicts the new single-flight contract and needs a rewrite.

> **Update (2026-07-13, brief draft recovery):** new suite **`brief-draft-recovery.test.ts` (§P, 10 cases)** — unfinished-brief autosave API (`/api/brief-drafts`): save → list → resume payload round-trip, in-place update (no duplicate), `?keepImages=true` delete + **no resurrection** via a stale autosave PUT (404 on unknown id), discard deletes the row's real MinIO image (uploads through `/api/briefs/images`, asserts the public URL dies), 5-per-user cap evicts oldest, 7-day TTL sweep (back-dates `updatedAt` via test-DB access — skips without `DATABASE_URL`), foreign ids 404 **including for admins** (no admin override, deliberately), trivial payload 422, oversized 400 (per-field zod cap) / 413 (64 KB serialized cap), unauthenticated → proxy redirect. Suite self-cleans (discards all rows before/after each test) so the cap never bleeds across tests. Full-suite count 122 → **132 passed**.

> **Update (2026-07-07, per-user Claude tokens):** new suite **`settings-claude-token.test.ts` (§O, 7 cases)** — self-service `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/me/claude-token` lifecycle (connect → replace → disconnect, masked `keyPrefix`, raw token never in any response/DOM), zod shape guard (400) vs validation failure (422 — under `MOCK_AI` a token containing `invalid` fails via the `mockClaudeTokenValidation` seam; the live path spawns a `claude -p` ping and can't run in this claude-html env), per-user isolation, proxy-redirect on unauthenticated calls, `/settings` page render (API-mode note, no CLI banner) and connect-via-form. `GET /api/me` now also returns `cliMode` + `claudeToken`. Test infra: `ApiClient` gained a `put()` method (`tests/helpers/api.ts`).

> **Update (2026-07-07, post-brief enhance):** §N gains one case in `briefing-assistant.test.ts` — **post-brief enhance** (`POST /api/briefs/enhance`, `withAuth` so _editor_-accessible unlike the campaign enhance): mock rewrite via the shared `buildMockBriefingEnhance` seam, topic-only drafting, 400 when topic AND content are blank, 404 on unknown campaign. Suite verified 7/7; expected full-suite count 103 → **104 passed** (full run not re-executed this session).

> **Update (2026-07-07, super-admin + username + briefing assistant):** two new suites — **`user-management.test.ts` (§M)**: super-admin CRUD on `/api/admin/users` (create-with-password → username sign-in, role toggle, deactivate revokes sessions + blocks sign-in, reactivate + password reset, self/super-admin guards, plain-admin and editor 403s); **`briefing-assistant.test.ts` (§N)**: campaign document lifecycle (upload/list/type-gate/5-doc-cap/delete), MOCK_AI chat (` ```briefing ` block → `briefingDraft`), enhance rewrite, transcript validation, editor 403s. Contract changes baked into existing specs: the seeded admin is **SUPER_ADMIN** (TC-AUTH-04 expects `super_admin`), the login page takes a **username** (pageLogin helpers fill the `Username` placeholder — an email still routes through the legacy flow). **Two hard-won test-infra rules:** (1) sign-in probes need a **fresh cookie jar per attempt** — a stale session cookie makes better-auth 403 (`MISSING_OR_NULL_ORIGIN`) on sign-in POSTs, masking the status under test; (2) the worker-flow suite **cancels stale PENDING queue entries in `beforeAll`** — the reused test DB accumulates due `__FAIL_GEN_ALWAYS__` retries that starve the tick's claim batch.

> **Update (2026-06-30, post size-picker):** the brief now picks a **size** (1:1 / 3:4) instead of platforms (channels default to both, chosen at publish time). Added **TC-GEN-A3** (3:4 portrait Path A → EXPORTED draft) and **TC-GEN-A4** (template/brief aspect-ratio mismatch → 400) in `path-a.test.ts`, plus a **3:4 portrait Path B** case in `path-b.test.ts`. **TC-UI-02/03** updated: step label is now "Size & Design" and Publish opens the shared `PublishDialog` (pick a channel + Confirm fires POST /api/posts). Net suite count 77 → 80 passed.

### Catalog implementation status (2026-06-30)

All §6 cases are now written. New/changed files:

- **Existing specs extended:** `brand-kit.test.ts` (TC-BK-02/04/05/06/07/08), `publish.test.ts` (TC-PUB-03/04/06/07/08/09), `path-a.test.ts` (TC-GEN-A2/03/04/05/06 + A3/A4 portrait & ratio-mismatch), `path-b.test.ts` (TC-GEN-B2 strengthened via DB + B3 portrait), `agui-refinement.test.ts` (TC-AGUI-06), `provider-registration.test.ts` (TC-PROV-06).
- **New spec files:** `auth.test.ts` (§A), `resolution.test.ts` (§C), `export.test.ts` (§F), `library.test.ts` (§H), `acp.test.ts` (§J), `regression.test.ts` (§K), `ui.test.ts` (§L).
- **New infra:**
  - `scripts/seed-editor.mjs` — the non-admin RBAC account (`editor@bisteccare.lk`, fixed test password — see `FIXED_TEST_PASSWORD` in `scripts/seed-admin.mjs`), wired into `setup-test-db.mjs`.
  - `tests/helpers/db.ts` — direct test-DB access for cases that can't be set up over HTTP. **It reads `DATABASE_URL` from `.env.test` FIRST**, because importing `@prisma/client` runs Prisma's bundled dotenv and loads the dev `.env` into `process.env` — so "process.env first" would wrongly hit the dev DB.
  - **`loginAs` now creates an isolated `APIRequestContext`** (its own cookie jar). The previous version reused the shared `request` fixture, so the admin cookie leaked into editor calls and RBAC tests got 200 instead of 403.
  - Two production-safe `testHooks.ts` seams — `buildMockCopy()` routes the brief topic into the mock caption, and `shouldMockPublishFail()` lets a `__FAIL_ALWAYS__`/`__FAIL_ONCE__` sentinel in the brief topic drive deterministic publish failures (TC-PUB-03/04, TC-REG-H12b) within a single serve.
  - **`POST /api/test/scheduler-tick`** — a test-only seam that runs one `runScheduledJobs()` pass so §K H12 can drive the scheduler over HTTP (Playwright's loader can't resolve the transitive `@/` aliases in the app module graph). **Dormant in prod: hard-404 when `NODE_ENV==='production'` AND 404 unless `MOCK_SOCIAL` is set, plus admin-gated.**
  - `playwright.config.ts`: the global `Content-Type: application/json` was **removed** (it overrode the multipart boundary and 500'd every upload route); `retries: 1` added (cold `next dev` route compiles flake under load).
  - ~~`.env.test` additions: `BISTEC_API_KEYS`/`BISTEC_ADMIN_API_KEYS`~~ **Superseded 2026-07-21 (team tenancy):** the env-key lists are deleted; the §J ACP-auth cases now mint real hashed `ApiKey` rows via `POST /api/team/api-keys` at test time — no env vars, no CI job env needed.
  - `npm run test:e2e:reg` runs the suite with `.env.test` loaded (handy for ad-hoc DB-aware runs); not required for a green run anymore (the H12 HTTP seam removed the reg-mode dependency).

**Contract corrections baked in (differed from the original §6 wording):**

- Unauthenticated API calls are **redirected to `/login` by middleware (3xx), not 401** (except `/api/acp`, which 401s at the route). TC-AUTH-03/07 assert the redirect.
- TC-GEN-A1/B1 etc. return **200** `{draftId,exportUrl}` (not 201) — already corrected in the skeleton, kept.

**The 4 intentional skips (everything else passes):**

- **TC-GEN-05** (generated image → public URL): the MOCK_AI agent never calls `generateImage` and there is no mock IMAGE-provider seam; the public-IMAGES-bucket guarantee it targets is covered by TC-REG-H10a.
- **TC-REG-H11b** (concurrency cap): needs a real-Chromium serve (`MOCK_PUPPETEER` unset); skips in the mock run.
- **TC-REG-H11a / H11c** (one Chromium process per run / relaunch-after-kill): require host process observation / killing Chromium — not auto-driveable from a black-box test; `test.skip` with rationale.

**Resolved infra dependencies (now run in the standard mock suite):**

- **DB-dependent cases** (TC-PUB-07/08, TC-EXP-01/03, TC-GEN-B2, TC-REG-H9/H10b/c) self-resolve the test DB via `tests/helpers/db.ts` (reads `.env.test`), so they run under `test:e2e:mock` — no reg-mode needed.
- **Scheduler** (TC-REG-H12a/b/c) drive the scheduler over the `/api/test/scheduler-tick` HTTP seam, so they run in the standard mock suite (no app-module import, no reg-mode).
- **ACP authenticated** (TC-ACP-02/03/04/05) mint a real `ApiKey` via `POST /api/team/api-keys` (team-admin session) and present the plaintext — always run, no env/job-env dependency (superseded 2026-07-21). TC-ACP-05 is folded into the generate_post output-signing assertion (the MCP stdio surface isn't HTTP-reachable).
  **Owner:** _unassigned_
  **Scope:** End-to-end coverage of the full app surface (API + UI) plus a dedicated regression suite for the 28 code-review remediation fixes (see [`code-review-findings.md`](code-review-findings.md)).

This document is the authoritative test design. Implement the cases below as Playwright specs under `tests/e2e/`. Every case lists an **ID**, **precondition**, **steps**, **expected result**, and (where relevant) the **finding it guards**.

## 0. Why this plan exists — current suite assessment

A Playwright skeleton existed under `tests/e2e/` but was **not functional as written**. All five blockers below are now **RESOLVED** (2026-06-23) — the 6 spec files (19 tests) run and pass. History kept for traceability.

| 4   | **Port mismatch** (config `:3001` vs dev `:3000`).                                                                                                              | ✅ Test app runs on **`:3001`** (`npm run test:e2e:serve`), matching the config default.                                                              |

(Per-run truncation between runs still TODO — see §2.) |

> **Bottom line (2026-06-23):** the 6 spec files are now green coverage, not drafts. The much larger §6 catalog (RBAC/IDOR, the §K remediation regression suite, §L browser flows) was still to be written at this point.

> **Update (2026-06-30):** the full §6 catalog is now implemented and green — see the "Catalog implementation status" block at the top of this doc.

### Reproducing the green run

```bash
# 0. Containers up (postgres + minio:9000 published) — docs/cold-start.md §0
npm run test:e2e:db        # create + migrate + seed the bistec_studio_test DB
npm run test:e2e:serve     # terminal A: app on :3001 with .env.test (mocks on)
npm run test:e2e:mock      # terminal B: run the suite (sets MOCK_* + TEST_BASE_URL)
```

---

## 1. Test pyramid & what E2E owns

E2E here means **black-box tests against a running app + real Postgres + real MinIO**, with the three external AI/social dependencies mocked deterministically.

- **Unit-ish (out of scope here, recommend separately):** `crypto.ts` round-trip, `resolveBrandKit` precedence, `backoffMs`, `resolveExportUrl` passthrough.
- **E2E (this doc):** HTTP API contracts, RBAC, ownership, generation pipeline, publish/schedule, storage URL behavior, AGUI, and a few critical UI browser flows.
- **Concurrency/integration (this doc, §K):** the H7/H12 race fixes — these need parallel requests, which Playwright `request` can drive.

---

## 2. Test environment & preconditions

### Infrastructure

1. Postgres + MinIO containers up (`docker compose up -d`), MinIO `:9000` published to host.
2. A **dedicated test database** (e.g. `bistec_studio_test`) so runs are disposable. Point `DATABASE_URL` at it.
3. Migrations applied: `npx prisma migrate deploy` (must include `20260623153740_h9_indexes` and `20260623154752_h12_scheduler_claim`).
4. Seed the baseline: `npm run db:seed` (admin user + Bistec kit + Hearts Talk kit). ~~and `node --env-file=.env.test scripts/seed-cli-provider.mjs` if using CLI mode.~~ **Don't seed the `cli` COPY provider (2026-07-27):** CLI mode needs no COPY provider at all now (PR #30 server-side, PR #40 client-side), and that row **masks provider-gating bugs** — it is exactly why PR #40's dead Generate button never reproduced locally. `.env.test` runs `DESIGN_PROVIDER=claude-html` (API mode) anyway, so it was never needed here.

### Required `.env.test`

> **⚠️ `DESIGN_PROVIDER` must be `claude-html`, NOT `cli`.** CLI mode routes `assemble-b` and the refine route through `runDesignAgentCli` (a real `claude -p` subprocess, ~59s per call). The `MOCK_AI` seam only short-circuits `runDesignAgent` (the API path). With `cli` mode the mock never fires and every generation test hits the 60s Playwright timeout.

```

### Known seeded accounts

- **Admin:** `admin@bisteccare.lk` (role SUPER_ADMIN, username `adminBTG`); the test-DB password is the fixed test credential — see `FIXED_TEST_PASSWORD` in `scripts/seed-admin.mjs` (used by `tests/helpers/api.ts`)
- **Editor:** _create one in a global setup fixture_ (no seeded editor exists — see TC-AUTH-05 precondition). Needed for all RBAC/IDOR tests.

### Per-run reset

Add a global setup that truncates app tables (keep `User`/`Account`/`Session` for the seeded admin, or re-seed) between runs so counts/asserts are deterministic. `fullyParallel: false, workers: 1` is already set — keep it until isolation exists.

---

## 3. Mock strategy (must be built before generation tests run)

The deterministic path uses small, test-only seams, all centralized in **`src/lib/testHooks.ts`** and each gated behind its env flag so production is untouched. **Implemented (2026-06-23):**

| Flag             | Seam point (file)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Behavior when set                                                                                                                                                        |

> The brief's `copyProviderKey` must still reference a real enabled COPY provider (brief creation validates it) — the seed registers the keyless `cli` provider, and the specs pass `copyProviderKey: 'cli'`. `MOCK_AI` only stubs the _generation call_, not the validation.

> **Alternative (no mock flags):** run with `DESIGN_PROVIDER=cli` + real Puppeteer (`PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH` + Claude CLI auth) + `MOCK_SOCIAL`. Slower, non-deterministic copy, but exercises the real render path.

> Note: the unused `tests/fixtures/mockHtml.ts` is superseded by `src/lib/testHooks.ts` (the seams need the constants server-side, where the app can't import from `tests/`).

---

## 4. Conventions for implementing cases

- Reuse `tests/helpers/api.ts` (`login`, `post`, `get`, `patch`, `del`). Extend it with `loginAs(email, password)` returning an isolated cookie jar so editor-vs-admin tests don't clobber each other's session.
- Each `describe` block logs in in `beforeEach`.
- Assert **status code first**, then body shape, then values.
- For multipart (`/upload`, `/artifacts`, `/briefs/images`) use Playwright's `multipart` option.
- Clean up created rows in `afterEach`/`afterAll` until DB reset exists.

## 6. Test catalog

Legend: **P** precondition · **S** steps · **E** expected. "Guards" = remediation finding regression.

### A. Authentication & RBAC

- **TC-AUTH-01 — Login success.** S: POST sign-in with seeded admin. E: 200, session cookie set.
- **TC-AUTH-02 — Login failure.** S: wrong password. E: 4xx, no session cookie.
- **TC-AUTH-03 — Unauthenticated API is rejected.** P: no cookie. S: GET `/api/library`, `/api/drafts/<any>`. E: 401.
- **TC-AUTH-04 — `/api/me` returns role.** S: as admin GET `/api/me`. E: 200 `{role:'admin'}`. As editor → `'editor'`. **Guards H13.**
- **TC-AUTH-05 — Admin-only mutations gated.** P: editor session. S: PATCH/DELETE `/api/campaigns/[id]`, `/api/projects/[id]`; POST `/api/posts`; any `/api/admin/*`. E: 403. **Guards H4.**
- **TC-AUTH-06 — `requireRole` case-insensitive.** S: as admin (`ADMIN` in DB) hit an admin route. E: 200 (not 403). **Guards the role-casing bonus fix.**
- **TC-AUTH-07 — middleware exact-prefix.** S: request a path that merely _prefixes_ a protected one (e.g. `/admincustom`). E: not wrongly treated as protected/exempt. **Guards M9.**

### B. Brand kits (admin)

- **TC-BK-01 — Create kit.** S: POST with colors/fonts. E: kit returned with id.
- **TC-BK-02 — Single-default invariant.** S: create kit A default, then kit B default. E: only B `isDefault` (atomic toggle). **Guards M1.**
- **TC-BK-03 — Prompt versioning happy path.** S: POST prompt content twice. E: versions 1 then 2; only latest `isActive`.
- **TC-BK-04 — Logo upload returns public URL.** S: multipart upload. E: `url` starts with `MINIO_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT`, **anonymous GET of `url` → 200** (no signing). **Guards H10.**
- **TC-BK-05 — Artifact upload + feedToAI sync.** S: upload LOGO artifact. E: `BrandKit.logoUrl` updated; artifact `url` public.
- **TC-BK-06 — Artifact DELETE clears kit field.** S: delete the LOGO artifact. E: `BrandKit.logoUrl` cleared / font removed. **Guards M5.**
- **TC-BK-07 — Upload size/MIME validation.** S: upload >10 MB file; upload an SVG to `/briefs/images`. E: 400 both. **Guards H8.**
- **TC-BK-08 — Non-admin blocked.** P: editor. S: any brandkit write. E: 403.

### C. Projects, campaigns & brand-kit resolution

- **TC-RES-01 — Campaign override wins.** P: project default kit X, campaign kit Y. S: resolve. E: Y, source `campaign`.
- **TC-RES-02 — Inherit from project.** P: campaign has no kit, project default X. E: X, source `project`.
- **TC-RES-03 — System default fallback.** P: neither set. E: the `isDefault` kit, source `system`.
- **TC-RES-04 — Soft-deleted kit/campaign skipped.** P: campaign kit Y is soft-deleted. S: resolve. E: falls through to project/system, never returns Y. **Guards M4.**
- **TC-RES-05 — Campaign→project reassign admin-only.** P: editor. E: 403.
- **TC-RES-06 — List endpoints bounded.** S: GET `/api/campaigns`, `/api/projects`. E: capped (`take:200`). **Guards M11.**

### D. Brief → generation (Path A & B)

> Requires §3 mocks (or CLI mode).

- **TC-GEN-A1 — Path A produces an EXPORTED draft.** P: kit + template + campaign + brief (`designMode:TEMPLATE`). S: POST `/api/generate/assemble-a {briefId,templateId}`. E: 201 `{draftId,exportUrl}`; `exportUrl` matches `^https?://`; `GET /api/drafts/[id]` → `status:EXPORTED`, `htmlContent` contains a brand color. **(Corrects path-a.test.ts.)**
- **TC-GEN-A2 — Path A bad templateId.** S: assemble with non-existent template. E: 404.
- **TC-GEN-B1 — Path B produces an EXPORTED draft.** P: kit + brief (`designMode:GENERATE`). S: POST `/api/generate/assemble-b {briefId}`. E: 201 `{draftId,exportUrl}`.
- **TC-GEN-B2 — Path B requires a brand kit.** P: no resolvable kit. E: 422 `NO_BRAND_KIT`.
- **TC-GEN-03 — Brief validation.** S: POST `/api/briefs` missing `goal`/`channels`/bad FK. E: 4xx with field error. **Guards M12 (parallel validation still correct).**
- **TC-GEN-04 — Brief validation is parallelized & correct.** S: brief with invalid campaign + invalid template + invalid provider. E: 4xx (any/all bad FKs reported). **Guards M12.**
- **TC-GEN-05 — Generated image stored as public URL.** P: mock image provider returns a data URL. S: run generation that calls `generateImage`. E: image embedded in HTML is a **public** URL (anonymous GET 200), so re-render later works. **Guards H10.**
- **TC-GEN-06 — Oversized template guard.** P: Hearts Talk template (1.81 MB). S: Path A with it. E: clean error (`Prompt too large…`), not a crash. **Known Issue regression.**
- **TC-GEN-A3 — Path A 3:4 portrait.** P: kit + PORTRAIT template + brief (`aspectRatio:PORTRAIT`, `designMode:TEMPLATE`). S: assemble-a. E: 200; `status:EXPORTED`; `GET /api/drafts/[id]` → `brief.aspectRatio:PORTRAIT`. **Guards the aspect-ratio threading.**
- **TC-GEN-A4 — Path A aspect-ratio mismatch rejected.** P: SQUARE template + PORTRAIT brief. S: assemble-a. E: 400 (no stretching; the wizard only offers matching templates, the API enforces it).
- **TC-GEN-B3 — Path B 3:4 portrait.** P: kit + brief (`aspectRatio:PORTRAIT`, `designMode:GENERATE`). S: assemble-b. E: 200; `status:EXPORTED`; `brief.aspectRatio:PORTRAIT`.

### E. AGUI refinement

> ⚠️ Contract updated 2026-07-17 (`async-draft-actions`): refine is async — POST returns **202 `{ok:true}`**; results arrive via the draft GET poll (`waitForAction` helper). Only the Override path stays synchronous.

- **TC-AGUI-01 — Refine creates a revision.** P: an EXPORTED draft. S: POST refine `{instruction:'make the background darker'}` → 202 → `waitForAction`. E: new revision row (found by instruction) with signed `exportUrl`; `currentRevisionNumber` advanced; `pendingActionError` null.
- **TC-AGUI-02 — Revision numbers are sequential.** S: three sequential refines (each 202 → `waitForAction`). E: revisionNumber 1,2,3; no gap/dup.
- **TC-AGUI-03 — Conflict card path.** P: mock agent returns a `{conflict:true,...}` JSON. S: refine → 202 → `waitForAction`. E: draft GET `conflict.{conflictId,explanation}` populated (never `pendingHtml`); `pendingConflict` set server-side; **no** new revision yet.
- **TC-AGUI-04 — Override applies pending HTML.** S: refine with `{overrideConflictId}` — **still synchronous**. E: 200 `{reply,revisionId,exportUrl}`; revision created, `pendingConflict` cleared.
- **TC-AGUI-05 — Restore a revision.** S: POST `…/revisions/1/restore`. E: `{exportUrl}` signed; `Draft.htmlContent` = that snapshot. (409 while a `pendingAction` is in flight — §Q.)
- **TC-AGUI-06 — Refine ownership.** P: editor B, draft owned by A. E: 403. **Guards H2.**

### F. Export

- **TC-EXP-01 — Export re-renders missing PNG.** P: draft with `htmlContent` but no `exportUrl`. S: POST export. E: `{exportUrl}` signed; draft `EXPORTED`.
- **TC-EXP-02 — Export short-circuit.** P: draft already has `exportUrl`. S: POST export. E: returns the (signed) existing one; no re-render.
- **TC-EXP-03 — Export needs HTML.** P: draft with no `htmlContent`. E: 422.

### G. Publish & schedule

> Requires `MOCK_SOCIAL`.

- **TC-PUB-01 — Immediate publish.** P: EXPORTED draft. S: POST `/api/posts {draftId,channel:'INSTAGRAM'}`. E: 201 `{postId,status:'PUBLISHED'}`; `platformId` set. **(Corrects publish.test.ts — singular `channel`, object response.)**
- **TC-PUB-02 — Schedule for later.** S: POST with future `scheduledAt`. E: 201 `{status:'SCHEDULED'}`; **no transient PENDING row persists** (query DB → status is SCHEDULED, never PENDING). **Guards H7.**
- **TC-PUB-03 — Publish failure → FAILED, never PENDING.** P: `MOCK_SOCIAL_FAIL=true`. S: immediate publish. E: 201 `{status:'FAILED'}` with `errorReason`; row terminal, no PENDING orphan. **Guards H7.**
- **TC-PUB-04 — Retry FAILED.** P: a FAILED post, mock now succeeds. S: POST `…/publish`. E: 200 `PUBLISHED`, `retryCount`/`nextRetryAt` reset. **Guards H12.**
- **TC-PUB-05 — Retry on non-FAILED → 409.** S: `…/publish` on a PUBLISHED post. E: 409.
- **TC-PUB-06 — Cancel scheduled.** S: DELETE a SCHEDULED post. E: `CANCELLED`. DELETE a PUBLISHED post → 409.
- **TC-PUB-07 — Publish requires exportUrl.** P: draft without export. E: 422.
- **TC-PUB-08 — Publisher receives a signed, fetchable URL.** Assert (via mock spy) the URL handed to `publish()` is an `https` signed export URL, not a bare object key. **Guards H10.**
- **TC-PUB-09 — Publish is admin-only.** P: editor. E: 403. **Guards H4.**

### H. Library

- **TC-LIB-01 — Admin sees all, editor sees own.** P: drafts from A and B. S: editor B GET `/api/library`. E: only B's drafts. **Guards H3.**
- **TC-LIB-02 — Status filters.** S: `?status=READY|PUBLISHED|SCHEDULED|FAILED|ALL`. E: correct subsets.
- **TC-LIB-03 — Search.** S: `?search=<topic substring>`. E: matching drafts only.
- **TC-LIB-04 — Pagination envelope.** E: `{drafts,total,page,pageSize}`; `take` honored.
- **TC-LIB-05 — Thumbnails are signed.** E: every `drafts[].exportUrl` is `https` signed (fetchable). **Guards H10.**

### I. Provider registration

- **TC-PROV-01 — `sk-ant-` → Anthropic.** (already drafted) E: 201 or 422-from-provider.
- **TC-PROV-02 — `sk-` → OpenAI.** E: 201/422.
- **TC-PROV-03 — Unknown prefix needs name+label.** E: 400 without, 201/422 with.
- **TC-PROV-04 — Available list hides secrets.** E: no `encryptedApiKey`/`apiKey` fields; `keyPrefix` is masked **last-4**. **Guards M10.**
- **TC-PROV-05 — Disable removes from available.** E: gone from list after `isEnabled:false`.
- **TC-PROV-06 — Default toggle atomic.** S: set provider B default for COPY. E: only one default per slot. **Guards M1.**

### J. MCP / ACP surface

- **TC-ACP-01 — No key → 401.** S: GET `/api/acp/manifest`, POST `/api/acp/run` with no/empty/garbage key. E: 401 (fails closed). **Guards H1.**
- **TC-ACP-02 — Valid key → manifest.** P: an `ApiKey` minted via `POST /api/team/api-keys` (plaintext presented once). E: 200 manifest. _(Env-list keys deleted 2026-07-21.)_
- **TC-ACP-03 — `run` input validation.** S: `generate_post`/`publish_post` with missing fields. E: 400. **Guards M6.**
- **TC-ACP-04 — MCP system-user FK.** S: `generate_post` via MCP. E: Brief/Draft created with a real system user id (no FK violation). **Guards L1.**
- **TC-ACP-05 — MCP getDraft signs exportUrl.** E: returned `exportUrl` is signed/fetchable. **Guards H10.**

### K. Remediation regression suite (the just-completed work)

These are the highest-value additions — they guard the H7/H9/H10/H11/H12 fixes specifically and need targeted setups.

- **TC-REG-H7a — Refine revision atomicity (rewritten for the §Q async single-flight contract; parallel assertion de-flaked 2026-07-22).** P: one EXPORTED draft. S: (1) fire **N=10 sequential** POST `/refine` (each 202 → `waitForAction`); (2) fire **N=10 parallel** POST `/refine`. E: sequential runs append **distinct, contiguous** revisions 2..11 with no 500s; under parallel fire every request is either **202 or 409, never 500** (the atomic `pendingAction` claim), and **exactly one revision is appended per 202 winner**, numbering still distinct and contiguous. Same H7 guarantee — contention never reaches the revision transaction. **Winner count is timing-dependent, not asserted:** the claim guarantees at most one action in flight at any instant, but under the instant `MOCK_AI`/`MOCK_PUPPETEER` seams a fire-and-forget action settles in milliseconds, so a later request in the batch can legitimately re-claim a slot an earlier winner has already released (≥1 winner). In production the model call takes seconds, so the batch truly overlaps and exactly one wins — that stronger property just isn't observable under mocks, so the test asserts the mock-stable integrity invariant instead of a fixed winner count (the old "exactly one 202, nine 409s" assertion was flaky for exactly this reason).
- **TC-REG-H7b — Concurrent prompt version save.** S: fire 5 parallel POST `/prompts`. E: distinct versions, at most one 409, no 500. **Guards H7.**
- **TC-REG-H7c — No PENDING orphan on crash-shaped failure.** Covered by TC-PUB-03; additionally assert DB has zero `PENDING` posts after the suite.
- **TC-REG-H9 — Index presence + query plan.** S: `SELECT indexname FROM pg_indexes WHERE tablename='Post'`; optionally `EXPLAIN` the scheduler's due-query. E: `(status,scheduledAt)` and `(status,nextRetryAt)` indexes exist and the due-query uses an index (not Seq Scan) on a seeded large table. **Guards H9.**
- **TC-REG-H10a — Public bucket anonymous read.** S: upload via `/briefs/images`; fetch the returned `url` with **no auth**. E: 200 + bytes. **Guards H10.**
- **TC-REG-H10b — Private export not publicly readable.** S: take a draft's stored export key, GET `MINIO_ENDPOINT/exported-designs/<key>` **anonymously**. E: 403. The API's signed URL → 200. **Guards H10.**
- **TC-REG-H10c — Legacy URL passthrough.** P: a draft row whose `exportUrl` is a full `http…` URL (pre-migration shape). S: GET `/api/drafts/[id]`. E: returned unchanged (no double-sign). **Guards H10 (`resolveExportUrl` passthrough).**
- **TC-REG-H11a — Browser singleton reuse.** P: `MOCK_PUPPETEER=false`, real Chromium. S: 5 sequential exports. E: all succeed; (if observable) one Chromium process for the run, not five. **Guards H11.**
- **TC-REG-H11b — Concurrency cap holds.** S: fire 8 parallel exports with `PUPPETEER_MAX_CONCURRENCY=2`. E: all complete successfully (semaphore queues, no OOM/crash). **Guards H11.**
- **TC-REG-H11c — Relaunch after disconnect.** S: kill the Chromium process mid-run, then export again. E: next export relaunches and succeeds (no permanently-dead handle). **Guards H11.**
- **TC-REG-H12a — Atomic claim, exactly-once.** P: one SCHEDULED post due now; **two** `runScheduledJobs()` invoked concurrently (import the function directly in a node test, two parallel calls). E: exactly **one** publishes; no double `platformId`. **Guards H12.**
- **TC-REG-H12b — Backoff retry then terminal FAIL.** P: `MOCK_SOCIAL_FAIL=true`, a due post. S: run the scheduler repeatedly (advance `nextRetryAt`). E: status cycles SCHEDULED with growing `nextRetryAt`, `retryCount` increments to MAX (5), then terminal `FAILED`. **Guards H12.**
- **TC-REG-H12c — Lease reclaim.** P: a post stuck in `PUBLISHING` with a lapsed `nextRetryAt` lease (simulate a dead worker). S: run scheduler. E: the post is reclaimed and processed. **Guards H12.**
- **TC-REG-L2 — Shared helpers wired.** Static/build assertion: `src/lib/apiFetch.ts` and `src/lib/brandkit/systemContext.ts` exist and the 8/4 former copies are gone (`grep` guard in CI). **Guards L2.**

### L. Critical UI browser flows (Playwright `page`, not just `request`)

A thin layer of real-browser tests for the highest-risk UI regressions (the rest is API-covered above).

- **TC-UI-01 — Login → dashboard.** Log in via the form, land on `/`, KPIs render (no 404 — the dashboard route exists).
- **TC-UI-02 — Brief wizard 5-step happy path.** Walk Campaign → Size&Design → Content → Images → Review → Generate; land on `/drafts/[id]` with a preview. (Path A blocks Continue until a template is chosen.) Step labels asserted: Campaign, **Size & Design**, Content, Images, Review.
- **TC-UI-03 — Publish button opens the dialog and publishes.** On a draft, click Publish → the shared `PublishDialog` opens; pick a channel + Confirm → POST `/api/posts` fires (not a navigation). **Guards H5.**
- **TC-UI-04 — Draft preview image loads.** The `<img src={exportUrl}>` returns 200 (signed URL works end-to-end in the browser). **Guards H10.**
- **TC-UI-05 — AGUI chat refine round-trip.** Type an instruction, see the preview update + a new revision in history.

### T. PPTX export

- **TC-PPTX-01 — Happy path, no re-render.** P: draft already `EXPORTED` with `exportUrl`. S: POST `/api/drafts/[id]/export/pptx`. E: 200, `Content-Type: application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation`, non-empty body starting with the zip magic bytes (`PK`); `exportUrl` unchanged (no new PNG uploaded).
- **TC-PPTX-02 — Render-if-missing.** P: draft has `htmlContent` but no `exportUrl`. S: POST the pptx route. E: 200 pptx body; draft ends up `EXPORTED` with `exportUrl` set (same side effect `/api/generate/export` produces, via the shared `renderAndStoreExport` helper).
- **TC-PPTX-03 — Needs HTML.** P: draft with no `htmlContent` and no `exportUrl`. E: 422. **Mirrors TC-EXP-03.**
- **TC-PPTX-04 — Cross-team 404.** P: draft belongs to Bistec. S: ClientX admin POSTs the route. E: 404 (no existence leak). **Mirrors the §R isolation pattern.**

## 7. Fixes required to the existing specs (before/while implementing)

1. `path-a.test.ts` — assert `{draftId,exportUrl}` then `GET /api/drafts/[id]` for `status`/`htmlContent`/`imageUrl`.
2. `publish.test.ts` — singular `channel`; expect `{postId,status}`; drop the array assumptions; add the FAIL→retry path.
3. All generation/AGUI specs — wire the §3 mock hooks so they stop unconditionally skipping.
4. `helpers/api.ts` — add `loginAs()` with isolated cookie jars for RBAC/IDOR tests (current module-level `sessionCookie` can't represent two users at once).
5. Align ports: run the test app on `:3001` or set `TEST_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000`.

---

## 8. Execution

Mock hooks (§3) are now built, and `.env.test` + the npm scripts below wire everything together. `.env.test` carries the test `DATABASE_URL`, `MINIO_*`, secrets, and `MOCK_AI/MOCK_PUPPETEER/MOCK_SOCIAL=true`; it is loaded explicitly via `node --env-file=.env.test` because `next dev` does not auto-load it.

```bash
# 1. infra — postgres + minio (:9000 published). See docs/cold-start.md §0.
docker compose up -d
# 2. test DB: create + migrate + seed (admin, Bistec kit, Hearts Talk, cli provider)
npm run test:e2e:db
# 3. start the app on :3001 with .env.test (mock seams active) — leave running
npm run test:e2e:serve
# 4. run the suite (sets MOCK_* + TEST_BASE_URL for the runner)
npm run test:e2e:mock
npx playwright show-report
```

Last green run: **145 passed / 0 failed / 4 intentional skips** (~1.7 min) on 2026-07-17 (`async-draft-actions` finalize; earlier baselines: 135/4 on 2026-07-14, 80/4 on 2026-06-30, skeleton 19/19 on 2026-06-23).

CI gate: **`.github/workflows/e2e.yml`** runs the whole suite (§A–§S, including §K) with mocks on every PR and push to `main`. To enforce it, mark the `e2e` check **required** in the `main` branch-protection settings.
