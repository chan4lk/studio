## Acceptance Criteria Summary

The build is considered v1 complete when all of the following pass:

- Any team member can go from a brief to a published post on Instagram + LinkedIn without brand/channel knowledge
- Path A (template-based) and Path B (AI-generated) both produce on-brand PNG exports
- AGUI chat refinement updates the design; undo restores prior revisions
- Admin can register/disable AI providers without a redeploy
- Scheduled posts fire within ±2 minutes of target time and survive a restart
- No API key or secret appears in any browser network response
- All 6 Playwright E2E test suites pass in CI
